AeroParker Registration Form README
===================================

Author: Michal Jonak <michaljonak.1999@gmail.com>

For my solution approach to this  problem I used two separate servlets, the 
source code to both can be found in Java Resources/src/servlet/.

As per the instructions this project was developed using: 
 - Apache Tomcat/7.0.109
 - Java JDK/1.8.3_333
 - MySQL/5.6.51


Within the root directory there is a compile_deploy.bat script 
which (on Windows) will compile the java files and deploy the contents of 
/WebContent to the webapps folder of the Tomcat installation
pointed to by %CATALINA_HOME%. It will also conveniently start Tomcat and allow the webapp to be viewed at
